The test management discipline focuses on two roles. The test lead, the person who is in charge of a test project, and the test manager, the person in charge of the future direction of testing in an organisation.

Administrative positions like team leader are not covered as they are not directly related to the act of testing.

The section is broken up into two sections; one for test lead and one for the test manager.

### Test Lead
**Concepts**

 - Is aware of and understands each of the other disciplines so that the test plan can include accurate resource provisions and estimates

**Responsibilities**

 - Provide input into processes for test design peer reviews
 - Provide input into processes for test case specification peer reviews
 - Provide input into processes for test execution peer reviews
 - Provide input into the defect workflow process
 - Produce a test plan without relying on a template
 - Provide input into the project initiation phase by supplying a high level testing strategy, test estimates and test resource needs.
 - Produce the test summary report at the completion of a testing project.
 - Allocate effort to members of the test team relative to their discipline
 - Negotiate sponsor signoff with the project owners
 - Discuss, mentor or train current employees on testing fundamentals
 - Communicate effectively with the project manager on project progress
 - Report to test management the performance of the project team
 - Produce metrics to test management regarding performance of the test team and the project
 - Effectively communicate with the development lead to negotiate test engagement
 - Effectively communicate with the development lead to negotiate defect resolution processes

**Artefacts**

 - **Test Plan** – outlines the testing effort to be undertaken on a given project. Includes scope, estimations, risks and issues, environment configuration, resourcing and required disciplines.
 - **Test Summary Report** – details the testing that was undertaken on the project and the state of the testing


### Test Manager
**Concepts**

 - Understands different estimation models, how they relate to testing within the organisation
 - Understand the various models that exist for software testing and which is one is more appropriate for the organisation
 - Understands the different test environment configurations
 - Is aware of and understands each of the other disciplines so that the test strategy can include accurate resource provisions and estimates

**Responsibilities**

 - Can estimate effectively for future testing effort
 - Define processes for test design peer reviews
 - Define processes for test case specification peer reviews
 - Define processes for test execution peer reviews
 - Define the defect workflow process
 - Plan the test environment configuration is best given the organisational resources
 - Define the structure for teams working within the testing area
 - Review current skill sets and allocate training or acquire new resources to cover current skill shortages
 - Define the role testing plays in the organisation
 - Recruitment and retention of skilled testing personnel based on current and future testing needs
 - Planning, deploying, and managing the testing effort for any given engagement / release.
 - Produce the short term test strategy
 - Produce the test future direction plan
 - Report to upper management the performance of the testing team

**Artefacts**

 - **Short Term Test Strategy** – defines the testing resources, training, approaches and utilisation over the coming 12-24 month period
 - **Test Future Direction Plan** – defines the testing resource, training and approaches to meet the expected organisational testing needs based on the CTO Future Direction
