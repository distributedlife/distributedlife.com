I was using Quality Centre today and it crashed out for some reason. I was delighted to experience a error dialogue that was 26 monitors in width. At the current resolution that is almost 27,000 pixels wide. I have no idea how tall it was and any error message that was meant to be conveyed was lost off the bottom of the screen.

How do I know that it was 26 monitors in size? I had to drag it that far just to reach the close button because it opened up on the top-right hand corner.
