title: Testing the Cache - Shared vs. User Level Caching

Another thing to consider when testing caches is how granular is the cache. Is it on a per-user basis or is it shared caching across all users. The latter has security considerations that I will get to in a subsequent post.

If the cache is on a per-user basis then it is likely the username is used in the key to distinguish between one userâ€™s cached object and another's.

When testing with multiple user caches you need to ensure the following:

 - When User A puts an object in the cache, User B does not get the cached object
 - When User A puts an object in the cache they get their object on subsequent requests
 - When User A puts an object in the cache, User B's access to its object does not alter any expiration policies.

When testing with a shared cache you need to ensure the following:

 - When User A puts an object in the cache User B gets the cached object
 - Either user can get the latest object when the cached object expires
 - When User B accesses an object placed in the cache by User A, the sliding expiration policy is extended
