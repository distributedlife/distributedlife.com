The more I talk about the eight disciplines and the fundamentals I feel that the fundamentals is just another discipline. It applies to all disciplines but that doesn't mean we should treat it any differently. 'We don't' as the fundamentals have learning objectives and as we learn we cross them off the same way.

The fundamentals description is: a set of learning objectives that support all disciplines of software testing. It's the common techniques, responsibilities and concepts that we use as testers.

Here is [the link to the current fundamentals information](/resources/futures-in-software-testing-fundamentals.html). In future the fundamentals will just be mentioned within the nine disciplines.
