I've rewritten the competency article so that I no longer use words like "competence". Whilst many people understood that this wasn't about implying one was incompetent when they were learning, some testers felt the need to specify competent in every discipline because they didn't want to be considered incompetent.

So after some discussion we changed the rating Scale from Level 0 which is the old 'unaware' to Level 5 – The old 'expert' rating.

The original article has been changed and all PDF documents have been updated.

Hopefully this will get people to use the provided definitions of each level rather than using the English definition of the word.

Here are the 7 road maps ([security is not included](/resources/futures-in-software-testing-the-security-tester.html)), the fundamentals and the self assessment measurement guidelines:
