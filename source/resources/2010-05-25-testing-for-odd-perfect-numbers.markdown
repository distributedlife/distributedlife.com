title: Testing For Odd Perfect Numbers

A developer has just given you a program to test; it takes no input and returns the lowest odd perfect number. [A perfect number is a positive integer that is the sum of its proper positive divisors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number#Odd_perfect_numbers).

It doesn’t help that at present that there are no known odd perfect numbers. His program may be correct given the assumption that such a number does exist but you may not have time to wait for the result.

The chances of this problem coming up in your day to day job are slim. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t know about approaches to solving the problem should it arise.

I have updated the road map for [software testing fundamentals](/resources/futures-in-software-testing-fundamentals.html) to include the following things:

 - Deductive reasoning
 - Inductive reasoning
 - Set theory from mathematic logic
 - Proof theory from mathematic logic
 - Techniques of program correctness
 - Hypothesis testing

I have no expectation for all software testers to be experts in each of these techniques or concepts. I do expect software testers to be aware of the concepts and to be able to identify when they are applicable. I’m definitely no expert so if you think these needs to be broken down a little more or revised then drop me a line and we can discuss it.
