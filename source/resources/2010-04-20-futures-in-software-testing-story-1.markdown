My first example is not from a new tester but someone who has been testing for about six years now. Sam (not her real name) is in a team leadership position. I asked her to do the assessment and she completed all eight. She took about 42 minutes to complete them all. She had peer reviewed some of my work so she was well aware of what was expected.

Now before doing the self-assessment Sam was had indicated interest in the [Infrastructure & Integration](/resources/futures-in-software-testing-the-infrastructure-integration-tester.html) discipline of testing. She wanted something more technical than the testing she had been doing to date ([user interaction](/resources/futures-in-software-testing-the-user-interaction-tester.html) and [behavioural & functionality](/resources/futures-in-software-testing-the-behavioural-functionality-tester.html)) but she was currently hurtling down the [management](/resources/futures-in-software-testing-test-lead-test-manager.html) discipline.

This was her initial assessment:

A few days after completing her assessment Sam came up to me and said; "You know what. I don't want to be in the management discipline any more". She had looked at the eight disciplines and realised that what she didn't like about testing was where she was headed and she had worked out why she was headed there. This new range of things to test was exciting. She had grown bored of the testing she had done over the past six years and her experience meant she was inevitably being pulled upwards and away from the real work.

However, Infrastructure & Integration testing was what she wanted to do and it was quite clear that within the organisation there was a substantial skill shortage there.

Sam produced a second chart on the direction she really wanted to go.

She then took this information and went to her the test manager. Her organisational professional development agreement was updated to include the direction she wanted to go in testing. She is a team lead and will stay there but the opportunity to learn a whole new discipline of testing has been provided. In the future I suspect she'll be the team lead of the infrastructure & integration testing team; should she follow through with her goals.
