How do we progress through the disciplines? As I've talked about previously each discipline has a road map that contains each of its learning objectives. These learning objectives are not in any order of importance; rather grouped into concepts, responsibilities, techniques, artefacts and lenses.

One of the key points about the learning objectives and the road maps is that they don't instruct you in how to go about testing. The idea is to define **what** needs to be learned and to leave the **how** to be defined by context.

Here is an example learning objective from the automation discipline road map:

 > *Understands how change impacts automation tests*

This learning objective does not tell you **how** change impacts automation tests. That is outside the scope of what you need to learn. There is more than one way to write an automated test and each of these ways have pros and cons that impact the severity with which change will impact an automated test.

As the learning objective cannot document each and every way that change could impact an automation test this information is left for the tester to research and learn. How is that to be done? Research, books, blogs, peers, mentors and trail, error and practice. The same way we learn anything else.

The main goal of each road map is to help you identify what you can learn rather than telling you how to test.
