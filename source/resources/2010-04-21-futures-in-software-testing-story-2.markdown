My second example is a junior tester and her story is one of the reasons why I came up with this program. Andy (not her real name) is a junior tester and she has been a junior for about 2 and a half years now including a period of time on maternity leave. During this time she has become increasingly frustrated at her lack of development.

She has completed an ISTQB Foundation Level course but was still a junior and hadn’t learnt anything new except accruing [domain knowledge](/resources/futures-in-software-testing-the-business-domain-knowledge-tester.html)

She had read the discipline overviews and completed her assessment but had put unaware or aware in most of the items. She felt that this information alone wasn’t sufficient to build a plan for where she wanted to be. So I sat down with Andy and asked her what kind of testing she was interested in. She described what she was interested in:

I want to be involved in actively trying to make sure we deliver systems that work with the users and not against them. Before I became a tester I worked in the organisation and was constantly frustrated by how the system gets in the way of our jobs rather than helping it. Even now after being a tester for two years I’m not doing anything towards that. All we do is make sure the system is functionally correct and hand it over. I want to work on the warming and fuzzy aspects of the user interface. Help give them a system that is easy to use, that is satisfying. Not something that is frustrating and unwieldy.

It something along these lines as I’m going from my memory here. I then took this information and showed her what I think she should work on:

- **User Interaction** – Andy wants a better user experience. By studying this discipline Andy will be able to provide feedback to the user interface designer after the UI wireframes have been produced and before they have been built. As she gets more experienced the UI designer will engage her directly to get her feedback before he releases the wireframes.
- **Business Domain Knowledge** – Andy can use what she knows and her experiences to help other testers increase their understanding of the business. As she develops this knowledge further Andy can actively involve herself in the project initiation phase and test the project proposal before requirements are even defined.
- **Behavioural &amp; Functionality** – Andy needs to continue to develop her behavioural and functionality testing abilities. The organisation relies on ever tester being proficient in this area in the least. Most projects only have one or two testers and therefore the bulk of “regular” testing will still have to be done by her.

This is Andy’s chart after our discussion
