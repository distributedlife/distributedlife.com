One of the advantages of specialisation within software testing is that testers are focused on their discipline. I was in a meeting where there was group of [behaviour & functionality testers](/resources/futures-in-software-testing-the-behavioural-functionality-tester.html) that were complaining about a user interface change that involved making a traffic lights control (a green, orange, red colour state indicator) to a tick/exclamation/cross control.

They felt that the new control was nothing more than the interaction designer making changes because she could.

The problem with using a colour circle to indicate state is that users with colour blindness can’t easily tell the state. It works for traffic lights because they use very precise colours to assist drivers with colour blindness and importantly include positional information as well. The bottom light is “proceed”, the middle is “stop if safe” and the top light is “stop”.
