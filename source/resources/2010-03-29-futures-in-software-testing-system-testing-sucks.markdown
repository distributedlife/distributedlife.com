I am going to talk about is the ISTQB definition of system testing:

 > "The process of testing an **integrated** system to **verify** that it meets **specified** requirements"

My issue with this is firstly it assumes the system is integrated; ISTQB has component testing but that isn’t done by testers. When testing integration systems it is useful to isolate each discrete product so that you can be assured of it quality before plugging it together. A service is a discrete business product that does not belong to any one project or system. It is at the enterprise level so testing has to be done before it first gets integrated. Failing to do so can cause issues down the track when bugs are revealed and contracts change.

The next issue is the statement is only about verification of specified requirements; I have examples of systems that are functionally correct but still have bugs in them. Just because the user didn’t remember to write it down doesn’t mean we should force them to accept defective software. Even still there are many ways to implement behaviour and all may be correct but some may provide a more simple, efficient, tolerant and satisfying interface. Therefore as testers we should be identifying these issues so that the best system possible is developed.

My final point is that the definition of system testing is giving our profession a name rather than describing what we do. Just like the term ‘doctor’ doesn’t describe what a doctor does, neither should we use the name for our profession to describe what we do. System testing is trying to do both.

We already have a name for our profession; that name is software testing and has been for a long time. Let’s use that.

What does a software tester do? Well just like a doctor there are specialisations in software testing. I am going to call these disciplines.

In my next post I will introduce what I see as the eight disciplines of software testing and why they are the eight disciplines.
