I’ll always remember what my mum told me about going to university:

> You don’t go to uni to learn knowledge; you go to learn how to ask the right questions.

Asking the right questions is a skill and is one that I feel relates to ones ability to be a competent member of a software development project.  Without asking the question you assume knowledge. **The trick is; knowing when you are assuming knowledge and have more questions to ask.**

Teaching someone to ask the right questions is harder than teaching knowledge. We focus so much attention into hiring people with good technical knowledge and in some professions, with good domain knowledge. By only doing that we miss opportunities to hire someone that asks the right questions and the hard questions.
