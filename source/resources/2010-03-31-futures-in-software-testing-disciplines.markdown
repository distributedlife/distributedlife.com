I see eight disciplines in the world of software testing. Each of these disciplines is necessary for most projects to be wildly successful. Some projects will not require all eight; a service or batch process doesn’t have a user interface and therefore won’t benefit from such testing.

The eight disciplines are:

 - Behaviour & Functionality
 - User Interaction
 - Management
 - Business Domain Knowledge
 - Performance
 - Security
 - Automation
 - Infrastructure & Integration

### Scope

Each of these disciplines define a testing specific set of responsibilities; roles and responsibilities that exist, in and around the testing effort are not covered here. They are not about testing. Examples of such jobs are:

 - Configuration Management
 - Environment Management
 - Team administration

The need for these positions in each organisation is different and should be look at on a case by case basis.

### Technical vs. Non-technical

The first four disciplines are non-technical whilst the last four are technical. When I mean technical I mean that the tester requires a more in depth of knowledge of the implementation to be effective rather than having a reliance on programming knowledge. This I feel is an important distinction to make as I have some fellow testers that are keen to get into technical testing and have no desire to become programmers.

### Career Development

One of the issues I see with ‘system testing’ and the development of testers is that when a new tester enters the profession they begin like as a ‘system tester’ and when they retire twenty years later they are either a ‘system tester’.  If they stay in one place for enough time they may transition from ‘junior’ to ‘senior’.

What I would like is that when a new tester begins their career they read about the disciplines of testing that interest them and work towards becoming an expert in those disciplines.

Right now I’m working with an organisation to see if this model will work for their testers because they need to increase their capabilities across the testing team but lack the definition or clarity of what can be done.

### Not specialised and not fundamental

My final point on this is that these disciplines are not isolated silos and Business Domain Knowledge is more relevant on this topic that the others. Each discipline looks at what needs to be tested in different ways and each tester is encouraged to learn about all the disciplines that interest them. I have experience in every discipline except some basic encounters with security testing. I know this which is why my current focus for testing development is in the security discipline.

The definition of a discipline is what **can** be done by a practitioner of the discipline; it will not cover **what** is done or **how** it is done. This are the basis of more dedicated training courses and well beyond the scope of what I want to say here.
