Now that I have laid out the eight disciplines, the fundamentals of software testing and how we assess ourselves. It is time to use this information to build a learning program taking us from where we are now to where we want to be.

After a tester has completed their roadmap, I ask them to take that information and plot it into a chart. It helps the tester to visualise where they are now. I use a rough approximation of their level using either the average or the mode. Where do most of the values lie?

You can use the spreadsheet yourself:

 - [here is a 2003 Office Excel file](/files/Chart.SoftwareTestingFutures.xls)
 - [here is a 2007 Office Excel file](/files/Chart.SoftwareTestingFutures.xlsx)
 - [here is the open document spreadsheet file](/files/Chart.SoftwareTestingFutures.ods)

I then get them to specify where they want to be; their current goal for software testing learning. The tester says: “I want to get to Level 5 in the user interaction discipline.” We mark that off. Each tester will care about certain disciplines more than others. This is natural and I recommend each tester consider 2-3 disciplines of interest.

We then plot that onto the chart and this is what they end up with:

This provides the tester with a visual goal of how the will look as a tester. The then take the road maps for the disciplines they were interested in and use them to work on the concepts, techniques and responsibilities they are lacking. This means reading books, blogs and articles. It means doing research and discussing with their peers and mentors. It means finding a mentor. It means going on training courses but most of all it means practicing.

The difference between Level 1 and Level 5 is practice. Once you have an understanding of the concepts and can apply them. It only takes practice to reduce your dependency on the guidance until you are at a point where you can guide others.

Practice when and where you can; some examples are finding and participating in a [weekend testing group](http://weekendtesting.com/). Other ways to practice are applying your new skill set on whatever maintenance change you are working on. The defects may be out of scope but you will get the practice you need.

I also think it is worthwhile testers getting out and doing training courses that are not specific to training. For example; an [Infrastructure & Integration tester](/blog/2010/04/futures-in-software-testing-the-infrastructure-integration-tester.html) will find value in doing a course on server administration.
