Application developers that go just a little bit further to make your life easier. Not theirs, yours. I was in the process of subscribing to a feed but the little RSS button in Firefox is playing up so I had to copy the url and click the "subscribe" button in <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">FeedDemon</a>. Low and behold it has already look in my clipboard, extract the URL and displayed it in the edit box.

All I need to do is click next.

Normally when the FireFox RSS button works FeedDemon is even more streamlined than that. It opens the subscribe dialogue on your behalf. However with their primary workflow broken due to external causes they still coded time saving functions into their products.

Thanks.

The question to the reader is: What can you do to make your application more efficient?
