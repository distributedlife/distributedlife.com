Each discipline consists a set of learning objectives that a tester should eventually learn. The goal is that each learning objective helps guide the tester in their studies.

The learning objectives cover five things:

**Concepts** - theoretical constructs relating to the discipline. For example the performance discipline has "understands what CPU starvation is and how it impacts performance."

**Responsibilities** - cover what, as a tester, I am responsible for. What I should be covering when I test a system. The business domain knowledge discipline has such responsibilities as "the identification of systems that require failure evident capabilities but do not feature them"

**Techniques** - are different ways of approaching a problem. For example the user interaction discipline has 'hallway testing' technique which can be used to identify user interaction issues; however hallways may not be available, as such the 'think aloud' technique can be applied for the same goal.

**Artefacts** - are the manifestations of the work performed by testers; this includes test cases and defects and test plans and performance test plans.

**Lenses** - are different ways of looking at a system within the bounds of discipline; this help the tester narrow their focus of the system. Each lens is applied one at a time. The behaviour and functionality discipline has such lenses as: Behaviour, Functionality, Compliance and Data Integrity
