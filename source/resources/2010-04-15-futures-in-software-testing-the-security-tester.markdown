The security tester is concerned with that the system implement is secured against vulnerabilities both within itself and with respect the production environment. The security tester understands the business and the levels of security required for internal usage and accountability as well as protecting against external attacks.

There are six aspects of security testing: Availability, Authorisation, Authentication, Integrity, Confidentiality and Non-Repudiation.

This is about all I have. I’m not a security tester although I’ve been doing much research on the topic it is the discipline of software testing I have the least knowledge and consider myself unsuited for prescribing what can be done by the discipline.

[There is the OWASP guide to web testing](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project) but the road map needs to cover the world of non-web testing as well.

If anyone is a security tester and wants to assist in preparing a road-map I would welcome the input.
