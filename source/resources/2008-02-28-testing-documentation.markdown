As of today I am now officially over the volume of testing documentation that accompanies any testing project whether it be large or small. It is ridiculous, we don't need that much information documented. I have an idea on how to solve this, and just as importantly why we should change.<br /><br />Watch this space... but don't stare at it, it's going to take at least a few weeks to get it nutted out.
