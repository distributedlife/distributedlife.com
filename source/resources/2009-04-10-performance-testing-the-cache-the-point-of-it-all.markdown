If you have the opportunity, turn caching off and measure the performance of the system. Then turn caching on and run the same test again; first with one user, then fifty, then five hundred all the way up to your expected usage scenarios and then beyond.

Caching exists to improve performance. It is nice to be able to tell those who funded the cache enhancement just how the cache has improved latency.
