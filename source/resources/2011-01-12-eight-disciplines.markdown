These are the eight starting disciplines of a learning framework that I hope will go a long way towards solving our three problems: [a lack of direction, an information deficit and retention](/resources/it-begins-with-a-sad-story.html).

 - Behaviour & Functionality
 - User Interaction
 - Business Domain Knowledge
 - Management
 - Performance
 - Automation
 - Infrastructure & Integration
 - Security

I'll briefly summerise the disciplines:

**Behaviour & Functionality** embodies traditional testing scope with an emphasis on the behaviour of the system. Behaviour is defined as the response of a system to interaction. User interaction is not covered here.

**User Interaction** covers testing the user interface, usability and the user experience. The user interaction tester knows that the success of a system extends beyond features sets and functional correctness and a system that helps a user achieve their goal can be more successful.

**Business Domain Knowledge** is about applying the testing skills set to the business domain. We ask questions like "what is the impact of software failure on business or on society as a whole?".

**Management** is where the test lead and test manager exist and the skills they bring to the profession.

**Performance** is about looking at the behaviour of the system under a variety of controlled circumstances. Performance testing is not just looking at the implementation but covers architecture design, network topologies and infrastructure provisioning. A performance tester should be able to identify performance bottlenecks when they are designed rather than after they are built.

**Automation** covers both the facilitation of testing and the verification of behaviour. The verification of behaviour is limited to what can be easily automated; services, APIs, batch processes and web interfaces.

**Infrastructure & Integration** looks at the interactions between software components and the interactions between software and hardware.

**Security** weighs up the competing concerns of protecting against external vulnerabilities and allowing the users to be effective in the system.

The first four disciplines are non-technical while the latter for are technical. By technical I mean that a deeper understanding of the implementation if required rather than knowledge of a programming language. An important distinction to make as I know testers who are interested in technical testing but are not interested in learning programming, a common assumption.

In time these disciplines may split into more refined specialisations and they are not mutually exclusive. The more a tester knows about each discipline the more effective they can be. Each discipline is a way of focussing our thoughts into related topics.
