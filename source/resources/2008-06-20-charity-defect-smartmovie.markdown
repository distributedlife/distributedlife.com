**Application:** SmartMovie v3.31

**Platform:** Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate - Service Pack 1

**Target Hardware:** Nokia N95 8G

**Defect Summary:** When a conversion reaches 99% percent and the application is minimised a message is displayed to the user that states: "Movie conversion is in progress. Are you sure you want to break conversion". Clicking No will displayed the same message repeatedly. Clicking Yes will cancel the conversion.

Once this occurs it is not possible to complete the conversion.

**Workaround:** Ensuring the application does not get minimised and the conversion will complete.
