I managed to lock myself out of the house today. A very smooth move. On top of this the super secret spare key was not in place. After an hour of trying to brake into my house I realised that I had fixed the dodgy window a few years ago. It seems my house is fairly secure.

Unfortunately my new phone doesn't have all my contact numbers on it yet and I was stuck with no-one to call. In the past I may have called a taxi and got to where I needed to go. Not today though. The future has arrived.

I got out my phone, connected to my home wifi and emailed for help. I then surfed the intertubes for a bit, found the work number of someone who can help and I called them. Then I chatted on IM for a bit and watched a movie until help arrived.
