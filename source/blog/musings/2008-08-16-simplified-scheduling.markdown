<p class="MsoNormal">As an event I think that the Olympic schedule is getting easier and easier to organise. If you consider how many records get broken each time and the majority of records involve some kind of time measurement. Each event is using less and less time. If you compare this to a team based world cup event the number of teams is increasing. This makes it harder and harder to organise an suitable competition that doesn't run too long.</p>
