After <a href="http://distributedlife.com/blog/2010/11/very-early-thirties.html">my post last Thursday</a> about how I would prefer gifts that make a small change in the world to someone; my friend James sent me a link to the <a href="http://www.oxfamunwrapped.com.au/ChooseAGift.php">Oxfam Unwrapped</a> page. There concept is the same as what I was suggesting; you can buy a buffalo or a water purification kit. The recipient gets a card and someone in need gets a buffalo.

For my birthday this year, my brother gave my the gift of sight by donating to the Fred Hollows Foundation.

What did you get for your birthday?
