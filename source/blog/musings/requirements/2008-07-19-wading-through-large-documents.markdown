On the current project we have an unwieldy 280 page user interface specification that is up to version 3.0 and managed to double in size within a two week period. This can be a bit of a pain to manage if the revision history isn't tip top and it certainly doesn't help the environment if you print it out.

My suggestion is to make your own copy of the document and then delete pages once you have finished with them. It gives you an accurate way of visualising your progress as well as helping to ensure you don't miss anything.

<strong>Note: </strong>I'm sure my university lecturers would have done the same when I co-authored a 710 page design document. Actually, based on the scathing comments that were written on it I'm sure they wished they asked for it electronically rather than printed, one-up, single sided. Take that mother nature!

<strong>2nd Note:</strong> Co-authored is a strong term, we did use a script to generate large swathes of the document.
