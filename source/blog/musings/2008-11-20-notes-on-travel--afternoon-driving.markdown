<span style="font-family: ">An effect I experienced when I drove to the coast was in the late afternoon when the shadows of the trees partially covered the road they created this zebra stripe of shadow and light. After 10-15 minutes of driving in the constant flicker from light to shadow I started to get very tired. Now, I’ve driven 14-15 hour days on plenty of occasions but I’ve never experienced this before and we had only been driving for just over two hours and that includes breaks.</span>
