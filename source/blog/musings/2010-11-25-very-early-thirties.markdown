I turned 30 today.

I'm not really fussed about the 'big day'; but I read in a book called "Red Dust" by Ma Jain that Confucius said "a man must take up a cause" (or similar; I can't find the quote online easily and the book is up in Canberra still).

I'm still not sure what my cause is; I've been winnowing down the list to what I truly care about and I'll decide when I'm ready.

One thing I am becoming more passionate about is helping the underprivileged. I personally don't like giving large sums of dollars to charities for ambiguous reasons and while services like [givewell](http://www.givewell.org/) help, it's my belief that people are more likely to give if the see a tangible benefit. This isn't always possible; but when you say it costs only $12 to educate a girl in north Pakistan or Afganistan for an entire year, I know that think in my head. That is so little money relatie to my current income, it is easy for me to give that right now.

Ideally I would like more charities that **can** provide such benefit definitions to do so; but this isn't always possible and in some cases inappropriate. I believe that sponsoring a child has been for a long time giving directly to the community where the child lives because of the issues around helping just one child in a villiage.

So this year instead of asking for gifts; my family still does gifts for birthdays I've asked that from now on; if they must spend money in my name they do so on one of these charities. I'll expand these as time goes by.

Perhaps this year; you could ask those who buy gifts for you to do the same. If know of a charity that I should include here; let me know. Maybe it can be built into a fully fledged service one day.
