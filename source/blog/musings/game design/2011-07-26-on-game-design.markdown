One of the things I've been toying with of late is board game and card game design. To me it's nice alterative to computer game design because it allows for rapid prototyping. One of the biggest difficulties we had trying to make No Horizons was being able see if something was going to work. With card and board games I can make the board and the cards in an evening and run through a few iterations to see how it plays.

One of the things I intend to talk about is blogging about the iterative design process of game design. What I learned from each attempt and some explanations on why I went for one feature over another.
