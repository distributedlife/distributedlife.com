Would you buy a ebook reader if you knew that for each physical book you owned you could give it to your a library in need, preferably in a developing country where your language is spoken and the ebook company would give you an electronic copy of the same book?

It would be in the interest of the ebook vender because you become heavily invested in their platform and it would be in your interest because your books are now consolidated in your shiny new device.
