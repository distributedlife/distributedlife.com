At the end of March I was down in Melbourne watching the F1. <span> </span>When I bought my ticket it cost me $99 for Race Sunday. <span> </span>When I was in Melbourne I noticed posters advertising the price for $125 where $25 was being donated to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal; like it was a good thing.
<p class="MsoNormal">That is not a donation. <span> </span>That is a tax and an offensive one at that. <span> </span>I don't have a problem people donating to those that lost everything and more. <span> </span>I went to SoundRelief in Sydney where all the money was donated to the Queensland Floods and the Victorian Bushfire Appeal. <span> </span>I knew this in advance, everyone paid the same and the organisers and performances donated their time and energy. <span> </span>Everyone donated something. <span> </span>The roadies gave their services for free on that day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What I object to is the Victorian Government and the F1 looking like the good guys by getting behind a good cause when they are in fact contributing a big fat fucking zero, forcing everyone who bought tickets after the fires to donate and then on top of all that, they keep the $1 remainder, no doubt as an "administration" charge for handling your donation.</p>
