For those that hadn't noticed, and I had only recently noticed, YouTube now supports high definition videos for upload. Presumably this is to give the owners of original content the ability to provide better content than the general public which rip tracks off whatever is going about.

The high definition video is a separate link but ends up as the same URL so you can't bookmark it. The link is also non-obvious. This gives me an idea. If you create a YouTube video so inane and unwatchable you would be able to put a second completely different video in the high definition channel. This could be whatever unscrupulous purpose you can think of. It is not secure being completely public, but if it is short lived content with a strict time-frame you can effectively use the Google infrastructure to transfer messages to your equally unscrupulous pals.

The trick is to find something that is truly unwatchable rather than something you thick is unwatchable but ends up becoming a meme like so <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBGIQ7ZuuiU">this</a>.
