<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>The use of the word developer with respect to Agile bugs me no end. I know that when it was originally coined “developers” meant anyone on the project team that helps develop the system. What it came to mean is that all you need for Agile is coders and nothing else. They can talk to business and get their user stories or similar requirements vessel and they can run automated tests to the cows come home, after that the users will come in a perform User Acceptance Testing. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Software doesn’t happen that way. I’m sure many coders with a god complex would like it that way because they see themselves as the centre of the development life cycle. The statement if you have no code you have no system is true but remember. If you have no users you have no value for your system and a hole in your pocket. No one should be the centre of a project team and the end user should be the focus of your software.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Now when I listen to Agile proponents blather on terms like business analysts and project managers but the tester is still missing. </span>The bottom line is that <strong>developers are testers too.</strong><span> </span>I’ve a quick any easy way to test my hypothesis. Ask a tester to write some code, it will have bugs in it too.</p>
