I had several interesting discussions today around who does what in the development cycle. There were discussions about whether user experience (UX) or customer experience (CX) should be responsible for considering the ‘end to end’ solution.

I never managed to vouch my opinion that the Business Analyst (BA) is in a key position regarding this as they can drive a change through the business that may not impact how a user sees the company and that the <strong>change may not have a technological solution</strong>. Having to focus on a user role or customer is a form of blinkers that is both good and bad depending on the scope of the project; <strong>not all customers are users and not all users are customers</strong>.

Another discussion was regarding the role of the architect and whether their primary role was to produce an artefact (the architecture) or was it to oversee the product lifecycle and make sure all work is aligned with the objective. I feel the role is more about an output and the process of design.

Naturally we define our role expectations based on our past experiences both positive and negative. Because of this each of us may have different opinions of who is best positioned to do what; or<strong> how we classify roles is fluid</strong>.

Everyone agreed that the tasks needed to be done we just don’t agree on whom. As long as the job is done and the expectation of who is doing what is sorted out early in the project, does it matter what the name of the role is?

I don’t think so.
