It has become time for me to review and renew what I had originally called <a href="http://distributedlife.com/blog/2008/02/test-case-structure.html">Rapid Test Case Creation or Action Target Scenario</a>. Both of these were poor names and I'm now in favour of Lean Test Documentation.

A name that was suggested to be me was Lint Free Test Documentation; why? Because they contain no fluff.

The whole purpose of the method was to reduce the amount of unnecessary effort that was being poured into test creation. My co-workers were spending more time documenting tests than executing tests. If you know me this is against my motto. <a href="http://distributedlife.com/blog/2010/03/if-you%E2%80%99re-not-testing-you%E2%80%99re-not-testing.html">If you're not testing; you're not testing.</a>

One of the issues that has been highlighted over the past two years is that people get hung up on the dots and dashes when a more sentence like structure would have been better. It detracted them from the purpose of the process. <a href="http://distributedlife.com/blog/2010/04/futures-in-software-testing-the-user-interaction-tester.html">User Interaction testing for the win</a>.

So stay tuned as I revamp it with at least 50% more vampire.
