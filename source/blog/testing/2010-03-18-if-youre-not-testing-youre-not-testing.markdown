That is my motto and I use it whenever possible to remind my fellow testers that all the peripheral work associated with testing can help you achieve a better outcome, but isn’t specifically testing.

If you don’t have time to execute tests because you’ve not finished writing your test plan; you’re wasting what time you have for testing with busywork.

Let me make things confusing; <strong>nothing in testing is more important than test analysis.</strong>

I see testing as two basic activities test analysis and test execution. Whilst test analysis is the most important, test execution should be given the largest amount of time.

Why is it this way?

Test execution is where you get find out whether the system is defective. Without test analysis you will not be able to create the necessary scenarios to reveal the defects.

If you can get your analysis done in as little time as possible you can spend more time testing and who doesn’t like testing?
