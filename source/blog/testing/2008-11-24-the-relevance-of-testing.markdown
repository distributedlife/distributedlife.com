<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Calibri;">I like to look in the back of software development books for the word “testing” or even “unit testing” in the index. If it doesn’t have an entry, I question its relevance in the world of software development. If it does have an entry I am often surprised if the location is before the last 10% of the book. </span></p>
