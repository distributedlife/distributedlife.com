We don’t serve the end user

Just to make this clear. The goal of the tester is to help build software; we do this by providing information to stakeholders about the software. In some cases the people paying for or building the software may not give a shit about the end user. Do you think testers working on a gambling system are really looking out for the end user as the user’s food money is being taken from them? Any tester on such a project should probably look up ethics at this point.

If you’re interested in the impact of software on people then look at all the ways that the software can interact with people. The obvious; the person at the terminal is user interaction. You also need to consider the people that manage the systems that run the application.

Take a step back and consider the impact of software on the business that it runs in. If a policing organisation implements a system that allows their operatives to store case information digitally there are many benefits. But if they have to use it at their desks when previously they could have filled some of it out on the road then those hours at the office are either going to come out of their time on the beat or they’re going to be working longer hours.

Take another step back and consider the impact of the software on society. What is the impact on society if the police were on the beat for an hour less each day? What is the impact on the families of those officers if they have to work an additional hour?

Software systems aren’t just users and terminals anymore, they haven’t been for a while; they’re integration with society can have non-obvious effects.

Identifying the benefit or impact of failure of a system is easy in comparison to the unexpected side effects of software.

There is more than one end user. Thinking otherwise is like wearing blinkers.
