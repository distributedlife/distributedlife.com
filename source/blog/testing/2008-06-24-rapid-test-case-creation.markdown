<a href="http://distributedlife.com/blog/2008/02/test-case-structure.html">Earlier this year I posted about my Action-Target-Scenario (ATS) method</a> for naming and documenting test cases. I will clean it up and move it to a permanent article off this page. I suggest you read it. Its a good way to document your test cases. Keep in mind that It is not a silver bullet. As a matter of fact that I have made slight variations to the setup to handle specific testing targets. I'll document them here as well when I get the time.

Until then here is a short anecdote on how the ATS can assist in writing large volumes of test cases. Quickly.

Over the past three working days I've put in almost 40 hours of work and have written just over 1150 test cases. That is almost one test case every two minutes. I used a slight variation on my action-target-scenario method that is more suitable for user interface testing. The target application is a web based application consisting of about 25 screens. At the same time I was writing my review of the user interface and functional specification.

If I had to document those 1150 odd test cases the traditional way, I would still be at work. I don't like my job that much. I don't even like testing that much.
