I used to play Sudoku a lot. In a prior workplace one of my fellow testers, Les, would photocopy the two Sudoku puzzles that came with the daily newspapers. He’d deliver them to my desk and we’d complete them over lunch. Sudoku is a single player game but it doesn’t mean you can't have a race.

In mid-late 2006 I suffered from glandular fever and didn’t work for the best part of three months but when I got back to my desk I found 180 pages of Sudoku puzzles waiting to be completed.

I like Sudoku for the same reason that I like the <a href="http://distributedlife.com/blog/2010/04/games-for-testers-logic-puzzles.html">logic puzzles from the other day</a>. They are logic puzzles with a set of rules but rely on the player to apply deduction and supposition within their head to solve the puzzle. An eraser is not to be used with this puzzle.

Sudoku is a good game because it a gets more complicate the number of logic jumps you have to make to verify a value. This can relate across to software testing where we have a mishmash of disparate rules that we need to draw together to identify potential issues.
