<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Chomp! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>“That was so good.” Johnny moaned with pleasure. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Chomp! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Each cookie was absolutely delicious but Mother said that he mustn’t eat them all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Chomp! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Johnny looked into the jar. It was dark but he couldn’t feel the bottom. He could only feel cookies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Chomp! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The chocolate bits melted as the hit is tongue exploding flavour in his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Chomp! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Fingers scout the jar like a spider investigating a capture in her web. A moment of disbelief as the fingers found nothing. Peering in Johnny spies one cookie stuck on the jar’s side.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>A wave of relief.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Chomp! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Oh Noes!</span></p>
