My brother told me a story that I feel is worth sharing. The other day he joined a free online poker tournament with several thousand other people and came somewhere in the 40's. His prize winnings, a meager 26 cents of online money to use at the online casino. He took his winnings to the blackjack table and played 10c hands until he had a dollar. At this point he joined another poker tournament that had an entry fee of $1.

He got knocked out about 8 positions from making his dollar back. This entire process took about 5 hours to complete. It just goes to show that you can still have good cheap fun these days.
