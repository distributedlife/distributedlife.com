“You don’t want to be friends?” There was a tremor her voice.

“I want to be friends. I just don’t want you to think you have to be friends because we’ve broken up and you think it the right thing to do. In the end we never call or see each other. What is the point? Let’s cut to the chase. If you want to be friends, we will be friends. Otherwise, let’s not stand on ceremony.

“Let’s be friends.” she said.

I never heard nor saw her again. Such a shame, I would have like to have been friends.
