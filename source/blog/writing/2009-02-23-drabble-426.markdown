A friend requested that my next drabble be a happier. This is the result:
<p class="MsoNormal">Within an instant my hands go clammy. A thin film of sweat creeps across my body. Moments later it becomes a flood. My life flashes before my eyes. Heart stops beating. Mouth, dry and tongue sticking to the roof. It cannot form the words for the answer I need. Vision collapses in and the question comes again, louder. This time it’s clearer. The answer is there in my head. I know this, I’ve always known this. Thump goes my heart, palms dry up, vision returns. The most beautiful sight I’ve seen. My mouth moves with its own purpose.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I do.</p>
