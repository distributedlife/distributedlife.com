<p class="MsoNormal">7:45 AM - the radio starts up. The disc jockeys are yabbering on about something. It’s not funny and I don’t care. Press the button, seven minutes more sleep. 7:52 AM - and they start again. I still don’t care and it’s still not funny. 7:59 AM - and we cut to the news. My clock is slow. A war is going on somewhere. A politician has reneged on a promise or maybe there was a scandal. Is anyone surprised anymore? Why are people shocked? Generation Y – Why are taking this constant barrage of lies, control and corruption from government and corporations. 8:09 AM – and the disc jockey introduces a new ‘Like a Version’. These are usually pretty good. This one is by Holly Throsby. She’s kind of cute. It’s the radio but I may just listen in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I don’t know how much of that last paragraph was true but the snooze button and <a href="http://www.hollythrosby.com/">Holly Throsby</a> singing on ‘Like a Version’ were true. She sung Berlin Chair which is a <a href="http://www.youami.com.au/">You Am I</a> song. For a period three and a half minutes I lay in my bed hoping that song wouldn’t end.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I had never heard the original version by You Am I. I hear people call it a great Australian rock song. I listen to it now and to me just not as good as Holly’s. Their voices are muffled, the track seems rushed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I had never heard the original version by You Am I. I hear people call it a great Australian rock song. I listen to it now and to me just not as good as Holly’s. Perhaps because I heard it first, but probably because I think the You Am I version sounds rushed. They race through the song. It is not all bad for You Am I as I will concede that although Holly is better looking than Tim Rogers, the film clip for the You Am I version is much better. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJBSP29NQxo">You can watch it here</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I've listened to this song a lot and even now I can listen to it twenty to thirty times, sometimes more, in succession without tiring of it. I think that, at some level, I can relate to the characters in the song; the pride, the fear of failing and the uncertainty that accompanies said failure.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From what I understand and I may be wrong in my interpretation. The song is about a relationship between two people, both with many issues. The singer, with low self-esteem, is frequently failing to meet the expectations of the second person and this second person who has an internal struggle but too much pride to ask for help. The singer keeps pushing the limits of their relationship and failing openly. She knows that she isn't perfect and at some level wants to show the second person that it's ok to fail and that she is there for him. She will be there till she breaks. He need not fear that no-one will be there if he does fail.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With or without an underlying meaning, there are few lines that stand out to me. I can't put my finger on why I like them. Perhaps it's a meaning I understand but can't explain. Perhaps they are just nice words in a sentence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And the following line, which would have to be my favourite of the song.<em> </em></p>

</div>
<p class="MsoNormal">I like this line, while it’s a little on the depressing side, has great imagery. It’s unclear whether he is watching her repeated failings out of undying love or an inaction that exists. Because to leave would essentially be leaving who he is.</p>
