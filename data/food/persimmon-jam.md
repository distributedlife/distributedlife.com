The instructions for making jam are insidiously simple. Dice fruit, heat to soften, mash, remove skin, add pectin, add sugar and put in a jar.

Our next door neighbour, a sweet old Italian woman gave Jess a dozen persimmons. "*Put them in a bag with an apple for a few days to ripen them up*". We didn't have any apples and we're far too lazy to buy one. the persimmons sat unripened on the kitchen bench for a week. Well, the kitchen bench, then the window sill, then back to the bench and then upon the fridge.

Hey! There are bananas up here!

Ok. No more fruit on the fridge.

I decided I would make persimmon jam.

# persimmon jam
I diced the fruit using a fruit slicer I found in the second draw down. When did we get this? It gave me little pillars of persimmon. Removing the seeds from these pillars was easy. I took a bite and was a disgusting chalky taste took over my mouth. I rue not getting an apple now.

I look up persimmons on Wikipedia.

Fun Fact: the persimmon is a berry.

Not so fun fact:

> Unripened persimmons contain the soluble tannin shibuol, which, upon contact with a weak acid, polymerizes in the stomach and forms a gluey coagulum, a "foodball" ..., that can affix with other stomach matter. These [foodballs] are often very hard and almost woody in consistency. More than 85% of [foodballs] are caused by ingestion of unripened persimmons.

Great.

> ... Coca-Cola has also been successfully used to chemically shrink or eliminate persimmon-related bezoars.

All good. The persimmons I have are unlikely to cause foodballs.

# to the stove!

Once diced I need to heat the persimmons. This will soften them up with the goal being to shove them through a sieve to remove the skin and any hard bits.

What a clusterfuck that became.

I heated the little bastards up. But the lack of ripeness meant little juice seeped from the flesh. I was expecting something like the consistence of stew. I got warm fruit pieces in a pan. I gave them a mush and add a touch of water to get things moving. The persimmon chunks relent and start to give up their juicy secrets.

Contents of one saucepan: persimmon sludge with chunks and skin.

The next step is to sieve the sludge to get rid of the skin and other hard bits. Apparently this is best done wirth a Foley food mill. I couldn't find one in the second draw down. I tried a sieve. It's like trying to force a pudding through hessian cloth. I managed to get about half a cup of juice. I switched to a colander and it performed slightly better.

# fifteen minutes later

I'm trying to use a spoon and a potato masher to force persimmon through either the sieve and colander. You can see me lift up the device and scrape the juicy froth from the otherside.

What the fuck am I doing.

I later read that people blend at this point. You'll later read that I broke the sieve with this ridiculousness.

I broke the sieve with this ridiculousness.

I combine my pathetic amount of frothy persimmon juice and the hand mushed pulp and put it back on the stove. It heats up and forms a nice stew consistency. Somehow I'm bringing this back from the persimmon precipice of disaster.

I add the pectin and let it boil. Now it's time for the sugar.

# sugar
One recipe I looked at suggest that I use 3.5 cups of sugar for 8 lbs (3.63 kg) of persimmmon. Another suggested I use 6 cups for 8 pieces of fruit. Am I making jam or flavoured sugar?

The fruit I had were about 100-150 grams (5.3 oz) each. This gives me a range of 1/8 to 3/4 of a cup of sugar per piece of fruit.

I called mum.

She hasn't made jam for twenty years but said that the sugar ratio was somewhere between 1:4 and 1:1 cups depending on the fruit used. Add a cup, if it's not sweet enough, add more sugar.

Such sensible advice.

Once I add the sugar it takes on a reassuring consistency. This is what I have been looking for. I let that simmer for a bit before applying the second piece of advice my mother gave me.

Have a plate and a spoon in the fridge ready. When you want to test the consistency take using the spoon to dab a dollup onto the plate. Put it in the fridge for another minute. What you have now is the eventual consistency.

I did this.
