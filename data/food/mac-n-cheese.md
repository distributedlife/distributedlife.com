I made Mac 'n' Cheese for the first time since I was a kid. Possibly, for the first time ever. I have few recollections of each mac 'n' cheese as a kid and I'm not sure of those few, how many I made myself.

I set about to make this simple, heart-warming recipe. A 'comfort food' as described by a friend. She makes her own version with Dijonaise. This is something that I learnt along the way. That each person I talk to has their own version of this homespun classic. Another friend has a *killer* recipe that involves gruyere, cheddar and bacon.

With no recipe in place and with the conversations mentioned above yet to happen, I set forth to Pinterest to find some inspiration.

# Overwhelmed

That is how I felt with the excessive number of recipes for Mac 'n' Cheese. Including dubiously titled articles like "21 Mac 'n' Cheeses That Are Better Than a Boyfriend".

I thought it best to go it alone.

I spilled a bag of macaroni into a pot, added a litre of full cream milk and a large knob of butter. I put that on low and grated some vintage cheddar and contemporary mozzarella. These I dumped into the pot along with some salt, pepper and some smokey paprika.

It looked like a boring, unhealthy meal. I grabbed a head of broccoli and sliced up the florets thinly. These went in and I cooked it until the pasta and the broccoli were ready.

# Underwhelmed

That's how I felt after eating a bowl of it. This is a numbingly tedious meal. I was so bored that I drank a glass of water to spice things up. That's tap water mind you. Sparkling would have been too much.

Uninspired and with an excess of Mac 'n' Cheese in the fridge, I started to talk to friends about the dish, who, could not help in telling me of their favourite recipe and their tweaks.

And I learnt something.

# It's all a dirty lie.

The more I listened to these people and their ideas the more I came to realise that they weren't eating Mac 'n' Cheese. They were making other dishes that started out as Mac 'n' Cheese. Any Mac 'n' Cheese that ends up in an oven with breadcrumbs, panko or otherwise, on top. That's a pasta bake or if it doesn't have a crunchy exterior, it's a casserole.

If I were to take a couple of pieces of bread, slather them butter and sprinkle hundreds-and-thousands over them, I would not call it bread to replace my boyfriend. I would call it hundreds and thousands; a different dish to bread, butter bread and, to toast. Although, had I a boyfriend, it would be beautifully ironic if I were to replace him with fairy bread.
