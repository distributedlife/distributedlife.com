I tried out the remote pairing tool Floobits the other day. It mostly worked. I like being able to see where my pair was on the page.

I suspect the trick is to remote pair much like a local pair. That is; to only have one keyboard between us or, if we have two keyboards to take turns. That'd solve this problem.
