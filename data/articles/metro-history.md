# Timeline / Metro map of world history.

This tries to visualise the world history of all countries as lines on a metro map.

  |    |
--o    |	(country end at event i.e. Ottoman Empire)
--o----|---
  o----o--- (country starts from event i.e. Australia)
  |    |
--o    o--- (country with the same name restarted i.e. Poland)

Each 'o' is an event that involves all countries that stop at that station. Each 'o' has a name and a date if the event exists.

Or,

Each 'o' indicates that the country had some notible event that year. The colour can be used to indicate the type of event and a number can be used to link multiple countries in the event.

The timeline can be zoomed out to see decade and century level changes or zoomed for subyear events
